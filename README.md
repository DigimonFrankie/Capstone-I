# Capstone-I

## Outline

- Data Source

- Identify the analytics questions

- Data Pre-processing

- EDA

- Build model

## Steps

1. Get the data by using Zillow API

2. Extract the data for all the states to get the top 10 states housing price

3. Extract the data for all the cities in the PA to get the top 10 cities housing price

4. Extract the data for the Philadelphia in order to do more EDA

5. Pre-processing the data to get rid of useless features

6. EDA:

- What is the amount for each type of the house (apartment, condo, house, etc.)?

- What is the average price for each type of the house?

- What is the average time on Zillow for each type of the house?

- Which type of the house has the most views?

- The distribution of the area of the house

- Which features contribute affects to the number of views of the house (pic types like normal pic, 3D pic, video walkthrough; house price; house for sale etc)

7. Other potential EDA to consider:

- Compare pricing just before pandemic hit US with pricing in May or later.

- Additionally: compare across Red vs. Blue states/cities, north vs. South states/cities, east vs. West states/cities

- If listing existed before the pandemic, and remains listed, has its price changed and how?

- General statistical analysis before vs. During pandemic (chose a specific month or months.

8. Build a model to predict the house price
